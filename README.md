# README #

I wanted to play with Python's Panda libraries and do some GPX visualization and what better source of data than 
my own tracks that I have cycled or ran. Let's see what everything I get to track and graph here. 



### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for me to visualize my various trips in different ways and try to draw interesting facts out of them. 
Most of this information may already be available on various sports apps, but I wanted to re-create these on my own from 
the recorded GPX tracks. 


### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up:
* Configuration: 
* Dependencies: 
* Getting SportStracker data. I got my data using the information and guides available on this Github repository: https://gist.github.com/KonstantinosSykas/dfe4c5e392e299ab9341d6e16299454f

### To Do or Wishlist ###

* I want to draw a planned route (from GPX) with an actual route on same map
* store all my activities in a sqlite3 database and make queries for segments and track points there
* energy consumed per each segment?
** total energy consumed over a period of time
* get information on max and min speeds over a period of time
* get max and min temperatures for segments over a period of time for the locations in the segments (maybe only start 
 and stop location is enough)
* get max and min altitudes for segments over a period of time
* hash track names before storing them to db to mask the actual track names

### Done Features ###

* Nothing done yet
